Kaggle Competitions Repository

# Kaggle_Competitions 🏆

This repository contains my Data Science and Machine Learning projects developed for various Kaggle competitions. The goal is to maintain an organized portfolio of notebooks, models, exploratory analysis, and solutions to showcase technical skills, document learning, and track progress across challenges.

## 🔎 Repository Structure

- `Supervised_Learning/` — Classification and regression projects using public datasets.  
- `Reinforcement_Learning/` — Projects related to RL tasks or specialized environments.  
- `Optimization/` — Challenges involving optimization, heuristics, or combinatorial problems.  
- `Predicting Loan Payback/` — Loan credit scoring and predictive modelling.  
- `Google Tunix Hack - Train a model to show its work/` — Project for Google’s Tunix Hackathon.  
- `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, etc. — General configuration files.

Each folder contains its own notebooks, scripts, and results, depending on the nature of the competition.

## ✅ What You Will Find Here

- Jupyter notebooks with full exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling.  
- Python scripts for data preparation, training, validation, and inference.  
- Reproducible ML/AI experiments with documented configurations and results.  
- Modular structure that allows each competition project to stand independently.  
- MIT license for open and reusable code.
